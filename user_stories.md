Details for Seeding CSVs
Download the dataset available here. This will include all of the CSV files that you will be using in this project. Since these files are large, you will want to set up your .gitignore so that when you add these files to the /db/csv/ directory they will not be pushed up to GitHub. However, this also means that each of the members of your team will need to download these files independently. Please note that there are idiosyncracies in the data that are outlined in some detail here. These may not be important to you at this moment, but this will be an important reference as you move through future iterations.

Update the seeds file in your /db directory and add the station.csv file to your /db/csv/ directory. When you run rake db:seed your development database should be populated with the information from the station.csv file. Your index should include a total of seventy stations.
